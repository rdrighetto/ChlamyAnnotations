# Nucleoplasm masks used for nucleosome averaging (EMD-19906)" 

Here are nucleoplasm masks (segmentations) used for template matching of nucleosome particles. The masks were created in Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a modified version of [MemBrain-seg](https://github.com/teamtomo/membrain-seg).

Segmentations are archived on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16619468
