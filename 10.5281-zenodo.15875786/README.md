# Tomogram segmentations for "Towards community-driven visual proteomics with large-scale cryo-electron tomography of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii" 

Here are segmentations shown in Figure 2 and 3 of the official dataset manuscript (currently under revision), made by Jessica Heebner (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Segmentations were created using ORS DragonFly, Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and [MemBrain-seg](https://github.com/teamtomo/membrain-seg).

Segmentations are archived on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15875785

For each tomogram, a ZIP file is provided, containing segmentation volumes stored as binary TIFF files, each labelled by tomogram number and molecular/organelle identity. TIFF versions of the corresponding tomograms are also available from the repo.
